*Please note that Kindle Comic Converter (KCC), or this wrapper (KCCPY) is not Amazon's Kindle Comic Creator nor is in any way endorsed by Amazon. Amazon's tool is for comic publishers and involves a lot of manual effort, while KCC is for comic/manga readers, and KCCPY to simplify KCC's use with Python.*
